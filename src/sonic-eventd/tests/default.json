Alternatively developer can test the new event by adding it to a custom event profile and use 'event profile <filename>' command to apply that profile without having to send SIGINT to eventd. Developer need to commit default.json file with the new event after testing it out. Supported severities are: CRITICAL, MAJOR, MINOR, WARNING and INFORMATIONAL. Supported enable flag values are: true and false.",
